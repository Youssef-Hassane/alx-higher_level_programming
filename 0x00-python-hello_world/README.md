## Concepts
This project focuses on the following concept:
- Python programming

## Author’s Disclaimer
Welcome to the Python world!

The initial projects are more "C-oriented" with simple tasks and no tricky syntax. If you've already worked with Python, more interesting tasks will come. Python, like C, has a style guide called PEP8, also known as PyCode.

Enjoy!
